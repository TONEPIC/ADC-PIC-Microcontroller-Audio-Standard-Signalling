# ADC-PIC-Microcontroller-Audio-Standard-Signalling

Everybody is allowed to participate in this project with a series of C/C++ codes, so in order to create a standard audio signalling based on microcontrollers and microprocessors. Basic codes added for different platforms as arduino, raspberry pi, avr ATMEL and ARM.
This project started with a simple code for guitar signal, showing result of a discretize audio conversion on four LED. This code been elaborated for family PIC12F.
Open source project for the guitar pedal developers and DIY community, which like create LED signalling and other hardware for equiliser equipments.
This project start today Sunday 7 June 2020, inviting all the community in the Social Networks and friends of Andalus Analogue Audio, Valvepreamp, Rhodium Electronics and Tanquelab.
Wecome to collaborate with your codes and corrections. Thanks all folks!
